# Frame_Transform
Frame Transform for quantum mechanics simulation or molecular dynamic

Problem: Often we construct a molecular structure from VMD or other software, or download a molecular from online website, the coordinate system is not what we want. 

Solution: Now what we can do is rotate the structure along a specific axis (), or rotate to a target cartesian coordinate, this is exactly what this repo is doing here.
